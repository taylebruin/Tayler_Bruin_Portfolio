            <p>
                As a senior at Brigham Young University with an expected graduation date of June 2023, I have gained a
                diverse range of experiences throughout my academic and professional career. While I initially pursued a
                degree in Computer Science, I later transitioned to Journalism, although I continued to cultivate my
                passion for technology through coursework in the IT department. One particular course that stands out is
                IT210 Web Development, where I participated in a bootcamp-style program that provided hands-on
                experience with various technologies to create CRUD functionalities for a task list, as well as
                comprehensive knowledge of web structure, unit testing, and other key concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
                My time spent in the field of Journalism has also proven to be a valuable asset in my current role at
                the International Center for Law and Religious Studies. Here, I have had the opportunity to apply both
                my technical and communication skills to develop websites that are not only effective and functional but
                also visually
                appealing. In addition, I have had the privilege of training others in
                various settings, such as my current role, where I am responsible for training my replacement by guiding
                him through accessing our GitHub and setting up development environments, among other tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to my current position, I worked in live graphics for several years, both at BYU Broadcasting and
                as a freelancer for organizations such as the Pac-12. In those roles, I developed a talent for training
                and guiding others to accomplish complex technical tasks in high-pressure, fast-paced environments.
                Additionally, during my mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I was responsible
                for training other missionaries in various roles, including as a "Trainer" for new missionaries as
                their first
                companion and as a "District Leader" responsible for overseeing the performance of eight other
                missionaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, my unique combination of technical expertise and communication skills make me a valuable
                addition to any team.
