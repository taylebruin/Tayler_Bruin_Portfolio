                </h1>
                <p>
                    The primary objective of this lab was to create a functional website,
                    leveraging a NOSQL database and the Microsoft Azure platform. The website was designed to
                    facilitate user registration and login via both traditional email and password credentials, as well
                    as OAuth2 with Google authentication. Upon logging in, users were granted access to a
                    task list, with the ability to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks as needed.

                    I had a small part to play in this project implementing topics tags on the articles. This required
                    understanding of many to many relational
                    databases. I cannot link to the code here but please feel free to explore the site itself.

                <h1 class="project-tiles-title"> Dignity for Everyone</h1>
                <p>As part of this project, I was tasked with rebuilding an existing website from scratch. To ensure
                    success, I collaborated closely with stakeholders to establish clear requirements and objectives. In
                    my capacity as project lead, I was responsible for overseeing all aspects of development work from
                    start to finish.
                <p>
                    One notable challenge during this project was the creation of a form for individuals to become
                    signatories, as well as a corresponding page to display the names of those who had completed the
                    form. This task was made more complex by a requirement that all names displayed on the page be
                    approved by a non-technical group prior to publication. To achieve this, I leveraged my expertise
                    with Gravity Forms API to streamline the approval process and ensure compliance with all other
                    project requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By successfully navigating this and other challenges throughout the project, I was able to deliver a
                    high-quality website that met the needs and expectations of all stakeholders involved.

                <h1 class="project-tiles-title"> ICLRS</h1>
                <p>As part of my primary responsibilities, I have been tasked with maintaining the iclrs.org site, which
                    involves content updates and the creation of custom pages for various events. Notable work I have
                    undertaken includes the creation of custom pages, which involved writing custom HTML, CSS and
                    JavaScript to
                    achieve different appearances and layouts, depending on the specific requirements of the page.</p>

                <p>My work has also encompassed the development of some basic CSS in-page, to ensure that YouTube videos
                    are displayed correctly and are responsive to different screen sizes. In addition, I have created
                    user-friendly layouts for various events, which provide attendees with easy-to-use schedules to
                    reference. As part of my role, I have also undertaken significant image editing work to ensure that
                    all content displays correctly, even when images are provided in the wrong format or size.

                <h1 class="project-tiles-title"> REST API and Unit Tests </h1>
                <p>
                    This IT210 Web development class project was divided into two parts, each aimed at demonstrating
                    proficiency in different aspects of software development.</p>
                <p>The first part involved the creation of software using Python to test an existing REST API. This unit
                    testing approach ensured that the responses received from the API aligned with our expectations.
                    Through this, I showcased my understanding and implementation of unit testing techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the second part of the project, I was tasked with recreating the REST API using Node.js.
                    This involved the use of technologies such as Shell, Mongo DB, and REST to develop a functional API.
                    This allowed me to utilize the previously created Python tester to verify that my Node.js
                    API was functioning as expected.
