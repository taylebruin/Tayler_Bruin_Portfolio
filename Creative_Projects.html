            <h1 class="project-tiles-title">Introduction</h1>
            <p>As a sports journalist for the renowned BYU Daily Universe, I had the privilege of covering the exciting
                world of BYU men's soccer during my first semester. Through captivating game summaries and engaging
                previews, I provided readers with insightful and comprehensive coverage of the team's journey,
                culminating in their conference and national championships.

                In my second semester, I expanded my skillset by transitioning to the video side of things. Each week, I
                created dynamic sports packages, showcasing my ability to produce compelling visual content.
                Additionally, I produced engaging social media stories, further demonstrating my versatility as a
                journalist.

                My time at the BYU Daily Universe has been an incredible learning experience and a valuable opportunity
                to hone my journalistic skills. I will finish my time at BYU this spring traveling to Palmyra New York to do
                a project on the 200 year anniversary of the Book of Mormon as my capstone course. I am proud to have
                contributed to the paper's exceptional reputation for
                excellence and look forward to continuing to produce high-quality content in the future.</p>
