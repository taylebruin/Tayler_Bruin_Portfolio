            <h4>Daily Universe Articles</h4>
            I have worked for the BYU Daily Universe for the past semester covering BYU men's soccer.
            All of the articles I have written can be found here.

            <h4>BYU Promotional Video</h4>
        This video was created for my Communications 312 class. The purpose of the project
        was to learn to record audio properly with a studio microphone setup, as well as
        gather shots that matched to the script we were given to create a promotional video
        for Brigham Young University. <br>

        <h4>Taki Video</h4>
        This video was created for my Communications 312 class. The purpose of the project
        was to learn to use shot composition correctly. This meant using a wide shot first.
        Then going into a medium shot, and then three or more tight shots. After that sequence
        we were to start over. There was a small visual effect I added which was the smoke on the Taki.
        Finally, if you are wondering yes, we did actually microwave it and he actually ate the microwaved Taki.
        <br>2/10 would not recommend eating.
