            I have worked for the BYU Daily Universe for the past semester on the sports desk. I was assigned to cover BYU men's soccer as my beat throughout the semester.
            The majority of my coverage for the team was game summaries and previews during their season this semester, which ended with a conference and a national championship.

            <h4>BYU Promotional Video</h4>
        This video was created for my Communications 312 class. The purpose of the project
        was to learn to record audio properly with a studio microphone setup, as well as
        gather shots that matched to the script we were given to create a promotional video
        for Brigham Young University. <br>

        <h4>Taki Video</h4>
        This video was created for my Communications 312 class. The purpose of the project
        was to learn to use shot composition correctly. This meant using a wide shot first.
        Then going into a medium shot, and then three or more tight shots. After that sequence
        we were to start over. There was a small visual effect I added which was the smoke on the Taki.
        Finally, if you are wondering yes, we did actually microwave it and he actually ate the microwaved Taki.
        <br>2/10 would not recommend eating.
