            <p>
                As a senior at Brigham Young University with an expected graduation date of June 2023, I have gained a
                diverse range of experiences throughout my academic and professional career. While I initially pursued a
                degree in Computer Science, I later transitioned to Journalism, although I continued to cultivate my
                passion for technology through coursework in the IT department. One particular course that stands out is
                IT210 Web Development, where I participated in a bootcamp-style program that provided hands-on
                experience with various technologies to create CRUD functionalities for a task list, as well as
                comprehensive knowledge of web structure, unit testing, and other key concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
                My time spent in the field of Journalism has also proven to be a valuable asset in my current role at
                the International Center for Law and Religious Studies. Here, I have had the opportunity to apply both
                my technical and communication skills to develop websites that are not only effective and functional but
                also visually
                appealing. In addition, I have had the privilege of training others in
                various settings, such as my current role, where I am responsible for training my replacement by guiding
                him through accessing our GitHub and setting up development environments, among other tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to my current position, I worked in live graphics for several years, both at BYU Broadcasting and
                as a freelancer for organizations such as the Pac-12. In those roles, I developed a talent for training
                and guiding others to accomplish complex technical tasks in high-pressure, fast-paced environments.
                Additionally, during my mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I was responsible
                for training other missionaries in various roles, including as a "Trainer" for new missionaries' as
                their first
                companion and as a "District Leader" responsible for overseeing the performance of eight other
                missionaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, my unique combination of technical expertise and communication skills make me a valuable
                addition to any team.

                <h1 class="project-tiles-title"> Dignity for Everyone</h1>
                <p>As part of this project, I was tasked with rebuilding an existing website from scratch. To ensure
                    success, I collaborated closely with stakeholders to establish clear requirements and objectives. In
                    my capacity as project lead, I was responsible for overseeing all aspects of development work from
                    start to finish.
                <p>
                    One notable challenge during this project was the creation of a form for individuals to become
                    signatories, as well as a corresponding page to display the names of those who had completed the
                    form. This task was made more complex by a requirement that all names displayed on the page be
                    approved by a non-technical group prior to publication. To achieve this, I leveraged my expertise
                    with Gravity Forms API to streamline the approval process and ensure compliance with all other
                    project requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By successfully navigating this and other challenges throughout the project, I was able to deliver a
                    high-quality website that met the needs and expectations of all stakeholders involved.

                <h1 class="project-tiles-title"> ICLRS</h1>
                <p>As part of my primary responsibilities, I have been tasked with maintaining the iclrs.org site, which
                    involves content updates and the creation of custom pages for various events. Notable work I have
                    undertaken includes the creation of custom pages, which involved writing custom HTML, CSS and
                    JavaScript to
                    achieve different appearances and layouts, depending on the specific requirements of the page.</p>

                <p>My work has also encompassed the development of some basic CSS in-page, to ensure that YouTube videos
                    are displayed correctly and are responsive to different screen sizes. In addition, I have created
                    user-friendly layouts for various events, which provide attendees with easy-to-use schedules to
                    reference. As part of my role, I have also undertaken significant image editing work to ensure that
                    all content displays correctly, even when images are provided in the wrong format or size.

                <h1 class="project-tiles-title"> REST API and Unit Tests </h1>
                <p>
                    This IT210 Web development class project was divided into two parts, each aimed at demonstrating
                    proficiency in different aspects of software development.</p>
                <p>The first part involved the creation of software using Python to test an existing REST API. This unit
                    testing approach ensured that the responses received from the API aligned with our expectations.
                    Through this, I showcased my understanding and implementation of unit testing techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the second part of the project, I was tasked with recreating the REST API using Node.js.
                    This involved the use of technologies such as Shell, Mongo DB, and REST to develop a functional API.
                    This allowed me to utilize the previously created Python tester to verify that my Node.js
                    API was functioning as expected.
