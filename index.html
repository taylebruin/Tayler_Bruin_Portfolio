            I am a current BYU student majoring in journalism. During my time at BYU, I studied computer science before switching to 
            journalism. The purpose behind my change was to help develop my skills in areas such as design and communication that I found
            most computer science students were lacking. I hope to be able to find work in the software development field post graduation in June.

            During my time at BYU, I have worked for many different companies. My primary position today is as a web developer for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.iclrs.org/">International 
                Center for Law and Religion Studies</a>. I have also worked in live graphics for BYUTV Sports as a student employee and for Pac-12 Networks and other major
                networks as a freelancer.

            At BYU I have completed the course IT210  with an A. The course is known to be very difficult and time consuming. During the course, we were taught
            the fundamentals of how to host a site through AWS and Microsoft Azure. We also created standard CRUD functions for a task list in a variety of ways,
            from simple HTML and JavaScript to writing our own API and using Vue as frontend. We also learned how to sanitize inputs and setup a variety of user logins.
