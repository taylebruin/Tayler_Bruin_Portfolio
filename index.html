            I am a current BYU student, majoring in journalism. During my time at BYU I originally studied computer science before switching to 
            journalism. The purpose behind my change was to help develop my skills in areas that I found most computer science students lacking, 
            primarily skills in design and communication. 
        </p>

            During my time I have worked for may different companies. My primary position is with BYU Broadcasting as a live graphics specialist.
            That job requires me to have the ability to solve technical and creative problems quickly and correctly to make sure the graphics that 
            go on air are ready and correct. That position also helped me to be able to get freelance jobs with many other companies such as PAC-12 Networks,
            Utah Jazz, Real Salt Lake, and others. Freelance jobs are something that many people choose to make into careers. I choose to strive for further growth
            in the realm of software development.

            For a time my minor at BYU was to be Information Technology. I had to drop the minor before finishing it due to scheduling conflicts. Before I 
            dropped the minor, however I was able to take and get an A in one of their hardest courses of web development which is similar to a boot camp. 
            During that course I learned how to create a website in various languages from html to using a Vue framework to pull data from an API that I wrote.
            I gained skills in many different areas that are demonstrated in this portfolio, and others that cannot be demonstrated because GitHub pages does not 
            allow me to have the server run code but you can see the code of completed projects under the technical projects tab. If you have any question or would
            like to discuss potential job opportunities please contact me at: <a href="mailto:tayler taylerbruin@gmail.com">taylerbruin@gmail.com</a>
